  title: "Nányuè Huáiràng",
  dates: "677–744",
  content: `<p>Nányuè Huáiràng (南嶽懷讓, Japanese: Nangaku Ejō) was one of the principal successors of the Sixth Patriarch Huìnéng and the ancestor through whom the Rinzai (Línjì) lineage traces its descent. Through his dharma heir Mǎzǔ Dàoyī, the most dynamic and innovative current of Tang Dynasty Chan would flow, eventually giving rise to the Línjì school.</p>
    <p>Before meeting Huìnéng, Nányuè studied with the National Teacher Huì'ān at Mount Song. When he arrived at Cáoxī to study with the Sixth Patriarch, Huìnéng asked: "Where do you come from?" Nányuè answered: "From Mount Song." Huìnéng pressed further: "What is it that comes?" Nányuè was speechless. He remained with Huìnéng for eight years, contemplating this question, before finally answering: "To say it is like any thing would miss the mark." Huìnéng asked: "Then is there cultivation and realization or not?" Nányuè replied: "Cultivation and realization are not absent, but defilement is impossible." Huìnéng confirmed his awakening, saying: "This non-defilement is what all Buddhas protect and care for; you are like this, I am like this, and so are all the ancestors in India."</p>
    <p>Nányuè taught at Mount Nányuè in Hunan Province (from which he takes his name), where the future master Shítóu Xīqiān also practiced. His most famous student was Mǎzǔ Dàoyī, and their encounter produced one of Chan's most beloved teaching stories—the "polishing a tile" kōan.</p>
    <p>Finding young Mǎzǔ sitting in meditation day after day, Nányuè asked what he was doing. "I'm sitting in meditation to become a Buddha," Mǎzǔ replied. Nányuè picked up a roof tile and began rubbing it on a stone. When Mǎzǔ asked what he was doing, Nányuè said: "I'm polishing this tile to make it into a mirror." Mǎzǔ protested: "No amount of polishing can turn a tile into a mirror!" Nányuè replied: "And no amount of sitting can make you into a Buddha."</p>
    <p>He then asked: "When a cart won't move, do you whip the cart or the ox?" The point was clear: the problem is not with the body sitting, but with the mind that seeks something outside itself. "If you are practicing sitting meditation, this is not sitting Buddha," Nányuè taught. "If you attach to the sitting form, you fail to grasp the essential principle."</p>
    <p>After ten years of training, Mǎzǔ awakened under Nányuè's guidance and received dharma transmission, carrying this teaching to transform Chan Buddhism through his dynamic methods of shouts, blows, and direct confrontation.</p>`,
