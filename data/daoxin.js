  content: `<p>Dàoxìn (道信), the Fourth Chinese Patriarch, occupies a pivotal position in Chan history, transforming the tradition from a loosely affiliated group of wandering teachers into an established monastic institution. Under his leadership, Chan developed its first permanent community, laying the groundwork for the great monasteries that would later flourish throughout China.</p>
    <p>Dàoxìn met Sēngcàn at the age of fourteen and remained with him for nine years, eventually receiving dharma transmission. After ordination as a monk in 607 CE, he embarked on years of travel before finally settling at East Mountain Temple (Dongshan) on Shuangfeng ("Twin Peaks") in Huangmei, where he taught Chan Buddhism for thirty years.</p>
    <p>This establishment of a permanent community marked a revolutionary change. Previous patriarchs had lived as wanderers, teaching individuals they encountered. Dàoxìn created a settled sangha where hundreds of students could practice together, necessitating practical innovations. Monks not only meditated but also farmed and maintained the community—a departure from traditional Buddhist monasticism that relied entirely on alms. This innovation would later be systematized by Bǎizhàng into the principle: "A day without work is a day without food."</p>
    <p>The "East Mountain Teaching" (<em>Dōngshān fǎmén</em>) developed by Dàoxìn and his successor Hóngrěn integrated several streams of practice: meditation on emptiness, contemplation of the "ultimate principle" leading to "one-practice samādhi," and concentrated absorption. The goal was to quiet the stream of discursive thought and allow the practitioner to realize the pure, luminous consciousness inherent in all beings.</p>
    <p>Dàoxìn also made crucial doctrinal contributions, unifying the Zen emphasis on the <em>Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra</em> with the Prajñāpāramitā teachings (including the Heart and Diamond Sutras), and incorporating elements of Pure Land practice, such as chanting. These integrations helped Chan appeal to a broader audience while maintaining its contemplative core.</p>
    <p>When the Emperor Tài Zōng summoned him to court, Dàoxìn declined three times, reportedly preferring execution to leaving his mountain community. Impressed by his resolve, the Emperor instead bestowed honors upon him. Dàoxìn died in 651 at age seventy-two, having established the foundations of institutional Chan Buddhism.</p>`,
