  content: `<p>Dòngshān Liángjiè (洞山良价, Japanese: Tōzan Ryōkai) was the founder of the Caodong school of Chan Buddhism, which Dōgen would later transmit to Japan as Sōtō Zen. His teachings on the "Five Ranks" (<em>wǔwèi</em>) and his famous awakening upon seeing his reflection in a stream have made him one of the most influential figures in Zen history.</p>
    <p>Born in Guiji (present-day Zhejiang Province), Dòngshān showed spiritual inclinations from childhood. As a young monk studying the Heart Sutra, he questioned his teacher about the line "no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind"—pointing to his face, he asked: "I obviously have these! Why does the sutra say there aren't any?" Unable to answer, his teacher sent him to seek a more capable master.</p>
    <p>After studying with several teachers, Dòngshān came to Yúnyan Tánshèng, under whom he trained intensively. When preparing to leave, Dòngshān asked Yúnyan: "If people ask me to describe your teaching in the future, what should I say?" Yúnyan replied simply: "Just this is it." Dòngshān was puzzled, and Yúnyan added: "Now that you bear this task, you must be very careful."</p>
    <p>For some time, Dòngshān could not penetrate these words. Then, while crossing a stream, he saw his reflection in the water and experienced profound awakening. He composed a verse: "Avoid seeking elsewhere, for that's far from the self. Now I travel alone, yet everywhere I meet it. It now is me; I now am not it. Understanding this way, I merge with suchness." The stream reflection became a powerful symbol: the image appears real but has no independent existence—it is and is not oneself simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Dòngshān's greatest contribution was the teaching of the Five Ranks (<em>wǔwèi piānzhèng</em>), a sophisticated schema expressing the interplay of absolute and relative reality: (1) the relative within the absolute, (2) the absolute within the relative, (3) coming from within the absolute, (4) arriving within the relative, and (5) unity attained. This framework, developed further by his successors, provided a way to express non-dual insight in a graduated but ultimately circular system.</p>
    <p>The Caodong school takes its name from "Dòng" (from Dòngshān) and "Cáo" (from his successor Cáoshān Běnjì), though ultimately Dòngshān's lineage through Yúnjū Dàoyīng would become the mainstream transmission, eventually reaching Dōgen via Tiāntóng Rújìng.</p>`,
