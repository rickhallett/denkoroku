  content: `<p>Qīngyuán Xíngsī (青原行思) was one of the principal successors of the Sixth Patriarch Huìnéng and the ancestor through whom the Sōtō (Caodong) lineage traces its descent. Through his dharma heir Shítóu Xīqiān, three of the five traditional "houses" of Chan Buddhism would emerge: Caodong (Sōtō), Yunmen, and Fayan.</p>
    <p>Qīngyuán lived and taught at the Quiet Abode Temple (Jìngjūsì) on Mount Qīngyuán in Jiangxi Province, from which he takes his name. Though fewer stories survive about him compared to his contemporary Nányuè Huáiràng (ancestor of the Rinzai lineage), his role in transmitting Huìnéng's teaching was crucial to the development of Chan.</p>
    <p>One notable exchange recorded in the <em>Transmission of the Lamp</em> captures his teaching style. When a monk named Shénhuì came to study with him, Qīngyuán asked: "Where have you come from?" Shénhuì replied: "From Cáoxī" (Huìnéng's monastery). Qīngyuán then asked: "What's the news from Cáoxī?" When Shénhuì remained silent, Qīngyuán observed: "Tiles and pebbles are still in your way." This cryptic response pointed to the student's remaining attachments and conceptual obstructions—even attachment to the idea of "nothing to say" was still something blocking the way.</p>
    <p>Some modern scholars, including Albert Welter, have questioned whether Qīngyuán was a historical figure or was invented by later generations to legitimize the lineage of Shítóu Xīqiān. Shítóu's original teacher, Huìnéng, died when Shítóu was only thirteen, too young to have received formal dharma transmission. Qīngyuán may have been inserted into the lineage to provide an authentic link from Huìnéng to Shítóu.</p>
    <p>Whether historical or constructed, Qīngyuán's symbolic role remains significant. He represents the transmission of the Sixth Patriarch's teaching through the lineage that would eventually emphasize "silent illumination" meditation—the approach that Dōgen would bring to Japan as Sōtō Zen. In 740 CE, he transmitted the dharma to Shítóu, setting in motion the stream of Chan that flows to the present day.</p>`,
