  content: `<p>Bǎizhàng Huáihǎi (百丈懷海, Japanese: Hyakujō Ekai) revolutionized Chan Buddhism by establishing the first independent Chan monastery and creating the monastic regulations that allowed Zen communities to survive—and eventually thrive—for over a thousand years. His famous dictum, "A day without work is a day without food," transformed not just monasticism but the very understanding of spiritual practice.</p>
    <p>Born in Fuzhou, Bǎizhàng became a monk and eventually sought out Mǎzǔ Dàoyī, becoming one of his principal disciples. His awakening came through the famous "wild duck" encounter: when Mǎzǔ suddenly twisted his nose, the sharp pain cut through all conceptual thinking, and Bǎizhàng realized the presence that had "been here from the very beginning." Later, asked what happened, he touched his nose and smiled: "It still hurts!"</p>
    <p>After receiving dharma transmission, Bǎizhàng established a monastery on Mount Bǎizhàng in Jiangxi Province. Before this, Chan monks typically resided in monasteries following traditional Vinaya rules, often as guests in temples of other Buddhist schools. Bǎizhàng created something new: a self-sufficient Chan community with its own regulations.</p>
    <p>His <em>Pure Rules of Bǎizhàng</em> (<em>Bǎizhàng Qīngguī</em>) introduced revolutionary changes. Most significantly, he required that all monks—regardless of seniority or attainment—engage in physical labor, primarily farming. This was unprecedented in Buddhist monasticism, which traditionally forbade monks from working the soil. The principle "A day without work is a day without food" made practice and daily activity inseparable. Bǎizhàng himself continued working into extreme old age; when concerned disciples hid his tools to force him to rest, he refused to eat until they returned them.</p>
    <p>This innovation had profound consequences. During the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution of 845, Chan communities, being self-sufficient through farming, survived better than schools that depended entirely on donations. The integration of work and meditation also expressed a core Chan insight: there is no gap between "spiritual" and "ordinary" activity.</p>
    <p>Bǎizhàng is also associated with one of Zen's most famous kōans—the "wild fox" story, in which an old man (a ghost of a former abbot) asks whether an enlightened person is subject to cause and effect. The correct answer Bǎizhàng provides—"not blind to cause and effect"—resolved the ghost's five hundred lifetimes as a fox and provides essential teaching on karma and awakening.</p>
    <p>His principal students included Huángbò Xīyùn (teacher of Línjì) and Guīshān Língyòu, ensuring that his influence would shape Chan for generations.</p>`,
