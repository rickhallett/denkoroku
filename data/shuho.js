  content: `<p>Shūhō Myōchō (宗峰妙超), posthumously honored as Daitō Kokushi ("National Teacher of the Great Lamp"), was one of Japan's most celebrated Zen masters. Founder of Daitokuji Temple in Kyoto, renowned for achieving profound awakening after just ten days of kōan practice, and famous for spending twenty years disguised as a beggar to deepen his realization, his life embodies the Rinzai ideal of fierce determination and ultimate freedom.</p>
    <p>Born in 1282 in Harima Province (present-day Hyōgo Prefecture), Shūhō showed spiritual precocity from age ten, when he turned from childish pursuits to serious Buddhist study. As a young monk in Kamakura, he had an initial awakening that deepened his resolve for complete realization. Around 1304, he traveled to Kyoto and became a student of Nanpo Jōmyō (Daiō Kokushi).</p>
    <p>His breakthrough came with astonishing rapidity. After concentrating on the kōan "Kan!" for just ten days, Shūhō experienced profound awakening. He later described penetrating to a state of non-duality where all opposites were reconciled. Bathed in sweat, he rushed to express his understanding—but before he could speak, Nanpo recognized his transformation from his very deportment and confirmed his enlightenment.</p>
    <p>But Nanpo told him he needed to deepen his realization through further maturation. What followed became legendary: Shūhō left the monastic world entirely, joining the community of beggars living along the Kamo River near Kyoto's Gojō Bridge. "Barefoot and unshaven, wearing only a tattered robe and a cloak of rough straw, he endured the cold and hunger of twenty winters as his insight deepened." His retreat from recognition was absolute—he lived as one truly having nothing to gain or lose.</p>
    <p>The story of his discovery is one of Zen's most charming tales. Emperor Hanazono, having learned that a great master was hiding among the beggars, devised a test. He announced that free melons would be distributed, with the instruction: "Come here without using your feet." The beggars shuffled forward on their knees—except one, who responded: "Give it to me without using your hands." Shūhō had revealed himself.</p>
    <p>Brought to the palace and presented with monastic robes, Shūhō began teaching. Emperor Hanazono became his student. In 1315, Shūhō built a hermitage in the Murasakino district of Kyoto called Daitoku ("Great Virtue"), which with imperial patronage grew into one of Japan's most important Zen temple complexes.</p>
    <p>Before his death in 1338, Shūhō named Kanzan Egen as his dharma heir, ensuring the continuation of the Ōtōkan lineage that remains the sole surviving line of Rinzai Zen today.</p>`,
