  content: `<p>Prajñātāra, also known as Keyura or Hannyatara, was the 27th Patriarch of Indian Buddhism and the teacher who transmitted the dharma to Bodhidharma. This mysterious figure holds a unique place in Zen history—recent scholarship suggests Prajñātāra may have been a woman, making her potentially the only female patriarch in the traditional lineage.</p>
    <p>Orphaned at a young age and without a family name, Prajñātāra was called "Precious Necklace" (Keyura) before ordination. According to the <em>Transmission of the Lamp</em>, when the 26th Patriarch Punyamitra encountered the young Keyura, he immediately recognized extraordinary spiritual capacity. A test of wisdom confirmed this intuition, and Punyamitra bestowed the name Prajñātāra, meaning "Wisdom Star."</p>
    <p>Evidence for Prajñātāra's female identity comes from multiple sources: the 13th-century Japanese text <em>Shōbōgenzō</em> by Dōgen refers to Hannyatara as female; Korean Zen records preserve traditions remembering Prajñātāra as a woman; and historical and oral traditions from Kerala in South India, where Prajñātāra lived and taught, recall a prominent female master from this period. Archaeological discoveries in Kerala have also confirmed the presence of a well-known woman teacher around that time.</p>
    <p>Prajñātāra's most significant legacy was transmitting the dharma to Bodhidharma and instructing him to carry the teaching to China after her death. According to tradition, Bodhidharma studied under Prajñātāra for approximately forty years, receiving his Buddhist name from this teacher. It was Prajñātāra's foresight that set in motion the transmission of Chan Buddhism to East Asia.</p>
    <p>If Prajñātāra was indeed a woman, her place in the lineage takes on additional significance—demonstrating that gender was no barrier to the highest attainment and transmission in early Indian Buddhism.</p>`,
