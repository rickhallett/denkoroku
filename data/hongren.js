  content: `<p>Hóngrěn (弘忍), the Fifth Chinese Patriarch, continued building upon the East Mountain Teaching established by his teacher Dàoxìn, transforming it into one of the most influential Chan centers of the Tang Dynasty. Under his guidance, the community grew to include, according to some accounts, over a thousand monks, and the dharma was transmitted to students who would shape the future of Chan Buddhism.</p>
    <p>According to tradition, Hóngrěn first met Dàoxìn when he was only seven years old. Recognizing the child's exceptional spiritual capacity, Dàoxìn asked his name. The boy replied that he had a nature (<em>xìng</em>) but it was not an ordinary nature—it was Buddha-nature. Asked his family name, he said he had none, for his essence was emptiness. Impressed by these precocious answers, Dàoxìn predicted great things for the child and eventually ordained him.</p>
    <p>After Dàoxìn's death in 651, Hóngrěn assumed leadership of the East Mountain community. He emphasized the Diamond Sutra in his teaching, particularly its core message that awakening cannot be grasped through concepts or scriptures but must be directly realized. His method focused on "guarding the mind" (<em>shǒuxīn</em>)—maintaining awareness of one's original, pure nature.</p>
    <p>The most famous episode in Hóngrěn's life concerns the selection of his dharma heir. According to the Platform Sutra, Hóngrěn announced a poetry contest to determine who had realized the deepest understanding. His senior disciple Shénxiù wrote: "The body is the Bodhi tree, the mind is like a clear mirror. Time after time we must polish it, and not let dust collect." This verse represented the "gradual" approach—diligent, continuous practice.</p>
    <p>An illiterate kitchen worker named Huìnéng, who had experienced awakening upon hearing the Diamond Sutra recited, had someone write his response: "Originally there is no tree of enlightenment, nor is there a stand with a clear mirror. From the beginning not one thing exists—where, then, is a grain of dust to cling?" Recognizing the superior insight in this "sudden" teaching, Hóngrěn secretly transmitted the robe and bowl to Huìnéng at night, making him the Sixth Patriarch.</p>
    <p>The tension between Shénxiù's "Northern School" (gradual enlightenment) and Huìnéng's "Southern School" (sudden enlightenment) would define Chan Buddhism for centuries. Though both schools eventually died out as direct lineages, the Southern School's approach ultimately prevailed, and all surviving Chan/Zen lineages trace their ancestry through Huìnéng.</p>`,
