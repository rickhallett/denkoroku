  content: `<p>Nāgārjuna is considered the most important Buddhist philosopher after the historical Buddha himself and is revered as the 14th Patriarch in the Zen lineage. Sometimes called the "Second Buddha," he founded the Madhyamaka ("Middle Way") school and articulated the doctrine of śūnyatā (emptiness) that became foundational to Mahāyāna Buddhism.</p>
    <p>According to tradition, Nāgārjuna was born into a Brahmin family in South India and ordained as a monk in his youth. He is said to have studied at Nālandā, the great Buddhist monastic university. A legendary account holds that he was invited to the underwater kingdom of the Nāgas (serpent beings), who had been guarding the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras since the Buddha's time. Nāgārjuna retrieved these "Perfection of Wisdom" texts and restored them to the human realm—hence his name, meaning "Noble Serpent" (<em>Nāga-arjuna</em>).</p>
    <p>His masterwork, the <em>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em> ("Root Verses on the Middle Way"), systematically deconstructs all fixed views and conceptual positions. Through rigorous logical analysis, Nāgārjuna demonstrated that all phenomena are "empty" of inherent, independent existence—not nihilistically void, but dependently co-arisen and conventionally real. This "middle way" between existence and non-existence, between eternalism and annihilationism, became the philosophical foundation for Zen's radical non-attachment to views.</p>
    <p>His famous statement captures this teaching: "Whatever is dependently arisen, that is explained to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, is itself the middle way." He used the logical tool of the <em>tetralemma</em> to show that things are neither existent, nor non-existent, nor both, nor neither—cutting through all conceptual grasping.</p>
    <p>Nāgārjuna's influence on Buddhism is immeasurable. The Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka reading of his thought became the official philosophical position of Tibetan Buddhism, and his teachings on emptiness deeply informed the development of Chan/Zen Buddhism, where direct insight into emptiness is sought through meditation and kōan practice rather than philosophical analysis alone.</p>`,
