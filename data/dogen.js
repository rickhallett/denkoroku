  content: `<p>Eihei Dōgen (永平道元, "Source of the Way") is the founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan and one of the most important religious philosophers in Japanese history. His masterwork, the <em>Shōbōgenzō</em> ("Treasury of the True Dharma Eye"), stands as one of the greatest philosophical achievements in the Japanese language—and perhaps in world literature.</p>
    <p>Born in Kyoto to an aristocratic family, Dōgen was orphaned young. His mother's death when he was seven or eight profoundly affected him, instilling an acute awareness of impermanence that drove his spiritual search. At age thirteen, he took monastic ordination at Mount Hiei, headquarters of the Tendai school. There, a question began to torment him: If all beings inherently possess Buddha-nature, as the teachings say, why is it necessary to practice? Why seek enlightenment if we already have it?</p>
    <p>Unable to find a satisfying answer in Japan, Dōgen traveled to China in 1223, at age twenty-three. After initially discouraging experiences, he met Tiāntóng Rújìng in 1225 and finally found his true teacher. During intensive practice under Rújìng, Dōgen experienced "casting off body and mind" (<em>shinjin datsuraku</em>) and received dharma transmission. When Rújìng asked what he had realized, Dōgen replied: "Body and mind have fallen away." Rújìng confirmed his awakening: "Body and mind have fallen away; the falling away of body and mind!"</p>
    <p>Returning to Japan in 1227, Dōgen declared he had "come back empty-handed"—no scriptures, relics, or secret teachings, only the practice of "just sitting" (<em>shikantaza</em>). He famously resolved his original question: practice and enlightenment are not two things—practice <em>is</em> enlightenment. We don't sit in order to become Buddha; sitting itself is Buddha-activity.</p>
    <p>In the 1240s, Dōgen withdrew from Kyoto and established Eiheiji Temple in the remote mountains of Echizen (present-day Fukui Prefecture). There, he trained monks in rigorous practice and composed the ninety-five fascicles of the <em>Shōbōgenzō</em>, exploring topics from the nature of time and being to the proper way to wash one's face. His most famous passage, from <em>Genjōkōan</em>, crystallizes his teaching: "To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things."</p>
    <p>Dōgen died in 1253 at age fifty-three, leaving behind a tradition that has grown to include nearly fourteen thousand temples in Japan and communities throughout the world.</p>`,
