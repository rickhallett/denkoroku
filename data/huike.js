  content: `<p>Huìkě (慧可), also known as Dàzǔ Huìkě, was the Second Chinese Patriarch of Chan Buddhism and Bodhidharma's dharma successor. His dramatic encounter with Bodhidharma—in which he cut off his own arm to demonstrate his sincerity—remains one of the most striking stories in Zen literature, symbolizing the total commitment required for genuine awakening.</p>
    <p>Before meeting Bodhidharma, Huìkě was a scholar named Shénguāng who had mastered Confucian and Daoist texts as well as Buddhist sutras. Despite his learning, he remained spiritually unsatisfied. Around age 40, he learned of a foreign monk meditating at Shaolin and sought him out.</p>
    <p>According to the traditional account, when Huìkě first approached Bodhidharma's cave, the master refused to see him. Huìkě stood in the snow all night, the drifts rising to his waist. When Bodhidharma finally acknowledged him at dawn and asked why he had come, Huìkě requested teaching to "open the gate of universal compassion." Bodhidharma dismissed him, saying his heart was too shallow and arrogant. To prove his resolve, Huìkě severed his own left arm and presented it to the master. Only then did Bodhidharma accept him as a student, bestowing the name Huìkě ("Wisdom and Capacity").</p>
    <p>The pivotal dharma exchange came when Huìkě said: "My mind is not at peace. Please pacify it." Bodhidharma replied: "Bring me your mind, and I will pacify it." After searching, Huìkě responded: "I have searched for my mind, but I cannot find it anywhere." Bodhidharma declared: "There! I have pacified your mind." In that moment, Huìkě awakened to the non-findability of mind—a direct transmission of Zen's essential insight.</p>
    <p>Huìkě studied with Bodhidharma for six years before receiving dharma transmission. His own teaching emphasized sudden enlightenment and the direct realization of one's true nature, establishing themes that would define Chan Buddhism. Living in turbulent times during the persecution of Buddhism, he sometimes taught while disguised as a layman. According to some accounts, he lived to the remarkable age of 106, transmitting the dharma to Sēngcàn before his death.</p>`,
