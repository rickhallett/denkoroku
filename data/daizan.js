  dates: "b. 1963",
  content: `<p>Julian Daizan Skinner Roshi (寿鸞大山 Juran Daizan) is a pioneering British Zen master who holds the rare distinction of being the first Englishman to receive Dharma transmission in both the Rinzai and Sōtō lineages of Zen Buddhism.</p>
    <p>Before embarking on his spiritual path, Daizan Roshi worked in the pharmaceutical industry. A profound calling led him to make a radical life change: he left his profession, sold his possessions, donated the proceeds to charity, and committed himself fully to Zen practice. His early training was in the Sōtō tradition under Rev. Master Daishin Morgan at Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in Northumberland, where he spent fourteen formative years.</p>
    <p>In 2003, he travelled to Japan to train under Shinzan Miyamae Roshi at Gyokuryuji—the historic hermitage of Bankei Yōtaku Zenji—immersing himself in the rigorous Inzan lineage of Rinzai Zen. After years of intensive practice completing the traditional kōan curriculum, Shinzan Roshi conferred inka upon him in May 2007, authorizing him to teach and transmit the Dharma.</p>
    <p>Upon returning to Britain, Daizan Roshi undertook a remarkable walking pilgrimage in the traditional <em>takuhatsu</em> style—walking from the Isle of Wight to the northern tip of Scotland, living solely on alms and the generosity of strangers. This 1,000-mile journey allowed him to connect deeply with the land and its people, and many of those he met along the way became his first students.</p>
    <p>These encounters led to the founding of Zenways (Zendo Kyodan) in 2007, continuing the lay-based Rinzai organization established by his teacher. In 2011, together with his students, he established Yugagyo Dojo, a dedicated Zen training center in South London. He also taught at The Buddhist Society—Europe's oldest non-sectarian Buddhist organization—until December 2011.</p>
    <p>Beyond Zen, Daizan Roshi has studied yoga extensively across Europe, America, and Asia. As a registered E-RYT500 yoga teacher with over 5,000 hours of teaching experience, he integrates these practices to offer a holistic path combining physical challenge with mental and spiritual development. He has developed professional teacher training courses in both yoga and meditation, fostering a worldwide community of Zenways teachers.</p>
    <p>A prolific author, his works include <em>In Heaven's River: Poems and Carvings by Mountain Monk Enku</em> (2015), <em>The Zen Character: Life, Art and Teachings of Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae</em> (2015), <em>Practical Zen: Meditation and Beyond</em> (2017), <em>Practical Zen for Health, Wealth and Mindfulness</em> (2018), <em>Rough Waking: For Those Confined And Homeless</em> (2019), and <em>Practical Zen Yoga</em> (2023).</p>
    <p>Through his unique integration of Rinzai and Sōtō approaches, his innovative teaching methods, and his commitment to making authentic Zen practice accessible to contemporary Western life, Daizan Roshi continues to guide practitioners at Yugagyo Dojo and through Zenways communities worldwide.</p>`,
