  title: "Huángbò Xīyùn",
  dates: "d. 850",
  content: `<p>Huángbò Xīyùn (黃檗希運, Japanese: Ōbaku Kiun) was the master whose fierce, uncompromising teaching forged Línjì Yìxuán, founder of the Rinzai school. His central teaching—that "mind is Buddha" and there is absolutely nothing to attain—was delivered through sudden shouts and physical blows that became the hallmark of the Rinzai tradition. Emperor Xuānzōng gave him the posthumous title "The Chan Master Who Destroys All Limitations."</p>
    <p>Huángbò was said to be unusually tall, with a prominent lump on his forehead that gave him a distinctive appearance. Before meeting his principal teacher Bǎizhàng, he is said to have encountered Mǎzǔ and possibly trained with several other masters. Under Bǎizhàng's guidance, he completed his training and received dharma transmission.</p>
    <p>His teaching is preserved in two texts compiled by his lay student Péi Xiū, a powerful Tang Dynasty minister: the <em>Chuánxīn Fǎyào</em> ("Essential Dharma of Mind Transmission") and the <em>Wǎnlíng Lù</em> ("Wanling Record"). These teachings emphasize One Mind beyond all dualities:</p>
    <p>"All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists. This Mind, which has always existed, is unborn and indestructible... It is neither existence nor non-existence; neither long nor short; it pervades the universe."</p>
    <p>Huángbò was famous for his use of physical blows in teaching. The <em>Blue Cliff Record</em> tells of a young novice monk—later revealed to be a future emperor of China who was hiding in the monastery—who asked Huángbò why he was bowing to a Buddha image. When Huángbò explained he sought nothing from Buddha, dharma, or sangha, the novice challenged: "Then what's the use of bowing?" Huángbò's response was a slap across the face. The novice complained that Huángbò was too rough. "This is no place to talk of rough and smooth!" replied Huángbò, slapping him again.</p>
    <p>His most famous student, Línjì, received only blows when he asked about the meaning of Buddhism. Three times Línjì questioned, three times Huángbò struck. Línjì left in despair to seek another teacher, but through his encounter with Dàyú realized that Huángbò had actually been showing him "grandmotherly kindness." Returning to Huángbò, Línjì shouted at his master—and was acknowledged. The transmission was complete.</p>`,
