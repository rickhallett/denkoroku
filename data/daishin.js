  content: `<p>Rev. Master Daishin Morgan (大心, "Great Mind") is a senior Sōtō Zen priest and one of the most experienced teachers in the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives. For over four decades, he served as Abbot of Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in Northumberland, England, training generations of monks and lay practitioners in the Serene Reflection Meditation (Sōtō Zen) tradition.</p>
    <p>Born in 1948, Daishin Morgan encountered Zen in the early 1970s and was among the first generation of Western students to train under Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett. He ordained as a monk and underwent the rigorous training program she had established, which combined traditional Sōtō Zen practice with adaptations suited to Western practitioners.</p>
    <p>He assumed leadership of Throssel Hole Abbey in 1982, transforming the former farm buildings in the remote Northumberland countryside into a thriving training monastery. Under his guidance, the abbey has maintained the demanding schedule of a traditional Zen temple—rising at 5:30 AM for morning meditation, engaging in periods of work practice, and following a disciplined daily rhythm—while also welcoming lay visitors for retreats and introducing them to meditation practice.</p>
    <p>Daishin Morgan's teaching style emphasizes the practical application of Zen in daily life. His dharma talks, many available through the abbey, explore how to bring meditative awareness to relationships, work, and the challenges of contemporary existence. He has consistently stressed that Zen is not about achieving special states but about learning to meet each moment with wholehearted presence.</p>
    <p>For fourteen formative years, Julian Daizan Skinner trained under Rev. Master Daishin Morgan at Throssel Hole, being ordained as an <em>unsui</em> (novice monk) in 1991. During this period, Daizan received thorough grounding in Sōtō Zen practice—the meticulous attention to form, the silent illumination meditation, and the integration of practice with everyday activity—that would later complement his Rinzai training in Japan.</p>
    <p>Now in his seventies, Daishin Morgan continues to teach and guide practitioners at Throssel Hole and through the wider Order of Buddhist Contemplatives, having dedicated over fifty years to the practice and transmission of Zen Buddhism in the West.</p>`,
