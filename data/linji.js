  title: "Línjì Yìxuán",
  dates: "d. 866",
  content: `<p>Línjì Yìxuán (臨済義玄, Japanese: Rinzai Gigen) was the founder of the Línjì (Rinzai) school of Chan Buddhism, which became one of the dominant traditions of East Asian Buddhism. His fierce, direct style—using shouts, blows, and provocative statements to shatter students' conceptual minds—established the template for Rinzai Zen practice that continues to this day.</p>
    <p>Línjì began his monastic life as a diligent student of both scriptures and meditation at Huángbò's monastery, where he trained for three years without ever requesting a private interview with the master. The head monk, seeing his sincerity, encouraged him to ask Huángbò about the essential meaning of Buddhism. Three times Línjì asked; three times Huángbò answered only with blows.</p>
    <p>Despairing that his karmic connection was insufficient, Línjì prepared to leave. The head monk sent him to visit Master Dàyú. When Línjì tearfully recounted how he had been struck three times just for asking about Buddhism, Dàyú exclaimed: "Huángbò treated you with such grandmotherly kindness, and you come here asking about your fault?" At these words, Línjì suddenly awakened. He exclaimed: "There's not much to Huángbò's Buddhism after all!" Dàyú grabbed him and demanded: "You just said you didn't understand, and now you say there's not much to it. What have you seen? Speak!" Línjì punched him three times in the ribs.</p>
    <p>Returning to Huángbò, Línjì shouted and slapped his teacher. Huángbò laughed and called for his attendant: "This lunatic comes here to pull the tiger's whiskers!" The transmission was complete.</p>
    <p>Línjì's teaching method centered on the shout (<em>hè</em>, Japanese: <em>katsu</em>), which he used in various ways: sometimes to test students, sometimes to express realization, sometimes to cut through delusion. He also developed the teaching of the "True Person of No Rank" (<em>wúwèi zhēnrén</em>)—the awakened nature present in each person, constantly entering and exiting through the senses: "There is a true person of no rank, always coming and going through the gates of your face. Those who have not yet recognized this—look! Look!"</p>
    <p>His recorded sayings (<em>Línjì Lù</em>) contain some of Zen's most provocative statements: "If you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha. If you meet the patriarchs, kill the patriarchs." This was not nihilism but the ultimate teaching of non-attachment—even enlightened concepts must be released.</p>
    <p>Línjì died in 866, having established a lineage that would spread throughout China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, where it remains one of the two major schools of Zen Buddhism.</p>`,
