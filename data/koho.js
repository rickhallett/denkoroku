  title: "Kōhō Keidō Chisan Zenji",
  dates: "1879–1967",
  content: `<p>Kōhō Keidō Chisan Zenji (高峰敬道知山) was the eighteenth Chief Abbot of Daihonzan Sōjiji, one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen, and the teacher who opened the doors of traditional Japanese Zen training to Western students—most notably transmitting the dharma to Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett, the first Western woman to receive full authorization to teach in the Sōtō tradition.</p>
    <p>Born in 1879 in Toyama Prefecture on the Sea of Japan coast, Chisan demonstrated early spiritual inclination and was ordained as a Sōtō monk at the remarkably young age of eleven. He pursued rigorous training in multiple temple settings, eventually receiving dharma transmission from Kōhō Hakugun in 1901.</p>
    <p>Chisan's credentials were unusually broad. Beyond his primary Sōtō lineage, he received confirmation of his <em>kenshō</em> (enlightenment experience) from both Sōtō and Rinzai masters—a dual recognition that demonstrated the traditional emphasis on genuine insight over institutional affiliation. This breadth of training would later inform his willingness to authorize Western students whose backgrounds differed from traditional Japanese monks.</p>
    <p>He served as Chief Abbot of Sōjiji from 1957 to 1967, leading one of the largest Zen institutions in the world during a period of post-war reconstruction and renewal. Under his leadership, Sōjiji maintained its rigorous training standards while also beginning to open to international engagement.</p>
    <p>Chisan's most significant contribution to world Buddhism came through his relationship with Peggy Kennett (later Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett). When she came to Japan in 1962, he accepted her as his student despite considerable institutional resistance to training a Western woman in an all-male monastery. He recognized her capacity and, over the following years, personally authorized her certifications—achievements that were unprecedented for women in Japanese Sōtō Zen and helped establish precedents that would later contribute to complete parity for women in the Sōtōshū.</p>
    <p>Chisan transmitted the dharma to Jiyu-Kennett and authorized her to teach and ordain in the Sōtō tradition, enabling her to establish the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives in the West. He died in 1967, leaving a legacy that extended far beyond Japan to the emerging Western Zen communities his actions had helped make possible.</p>`,
