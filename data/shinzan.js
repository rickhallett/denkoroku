  dates: "1935–2021",
  content: `<p>Shinzan Miyamae Roshi (宮前心山) was born Junichi Miyamae in Niigata, Japan in 1935. After studying economics at Doshisha University in Kyoto, he pursued a business career. A devastating business failure in his thirties brought him to the brink of despair—a crisis that paradoxically became the catalyst for his profound spiritual journey.</p>
    <p>He was ordained as a Zen monk by Mitsui Daishin Roshi (1903–1992), under whom he trained in the rigorous Inzan lineage of Rinzai Zen. In 1990, Shinzan Roshi undertook the restoration of Gyokuryuji, the historic hermitage of the celebrated Edo-period master Bankei Yōtaku Zenji (1622–1693), located in Gifu Prefecture. This was not merely an architectural restoration but a spiritual revival—an attempt to return to what he saw as the authentic heart of Rinzai practice: the direct cultivation of spiritual insight.</p>
    <p>A fearless iconoclast, Shinzan Roshi was openly critical of the commercialization and institutionalization of modern Zen, particularly the traditional system of funeral charges that supported temples. In 2005, by mutual agreement with the Myōshinji headquarters, he withdrew from the branch to teach as an independent monk. He founded Zendo Kyodan (禅道教団 – Zenways Sangha), a primarily lay-based organization dedicated to making authentic Zen practice accessible beyond traditional monastic settings.</p>
    <p>His compassion knew no boundaries—he was notably willing to teach former members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult after the 1995 Tokyo subway attacks, a stance that set him apart from the mainstream Buddhist establishment but reflected his belief that no one was beyond transformation.</p>
    <p>As a Zen artist, his bold calligraphy embodied over half a century of practice—each brushstroke reflecting his fearless and indomitable character. His life and art were celebrated in the 2015 book <em>The Zen Character: Life, Art and Teachings of Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae</em>, published to commemorate his eightieth birthday.</p>
    <p>Shinzan Roshi transmitted the Dharma to Julian Daizan Skinner in May 2007—making him the first Englishman to receive inka in the Rinzai tradition—followed by Melody Cornell Eshin Roshi (2009), Matt Shinkai Kane (2017), and Tomio Yugaku Ameku and Barbara Jikai Gabrys (2018). He continued teaching at Gyokuryuji until his passing in 2021, leaving a legacy of unwavering dedication to authentic practice.</p>`,
