  content: `<p>Kōun Ejō (孤雲懐奘, "Solitary Cloud, Cherishing Wisdom") was Dōgen's closest disciple and dharma heir, the second abbot of Eiheiji Temple, and the devoted compiler who preserved Dōgen's teachings for posterity. Without Ejō's tireless work in recording and organizing Dōgen's writings, much of what we know of Sōtō Zen's founder might have been lost.</p>
    <p>Born in 1198 to the aristocratic Fujiwara clan in Kyoto, Ejō was ordained at age eighteen as a Tendai monk on Mount Hiei. However, he soon became drawn to the Daruma-shū, an early Japanese Zen school founded by Dainichi Nōnin. In 1234, he met Dōgen, who had recently returned from China, and immediately recognized in him an authentic master.</p>
    <p>Ejō formally became Dōgen's disciple in 1235, receiving the bodhisattva precepts. Just one year later, in 1236, Dōgen transmitted the dharma to him—an unusually rapid transmission that reflected both Ejō's prior training and his exceptional capacity. Ejō was appointed chief monk and began the work that would define his life: assisting Dōgen with the compilation of the <em>Shōbōgenzō</em> and recording his informal talks.</p>
    <p>The <em>Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki</em> ("Record of Things Heard from the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye") is Ejō's compilation of Dōgen's informal dharma talks—intimate teachings on everything from the importance of casting away self-concern to practical advice on meditation posture. These records, more accessible than the philosophical heights of the <em>Shōbōgenzō</em>, have guided practitioners for centuries.</p>
    <p>When Dōgen died in 1253, Ejō became the second abbot of Eiheiji, a position he held for nearly three decades. His abbacy was marked by the "Third Generation Controversy" (<em>sandai sōron</em>)—a dispute over his chosen successor, Gikai, whose innovative approaches to making Zen more accessible troubled traditionalists in the community. Under pressure, Gikai eventually departed, and Ejō resumed the abbacy despite his advanced age and failing health.</p>
    <p>At age eighty-one, Ejō completed his only original work, the <em>Kōmyōzō Zanmai</em> ("Samādhi of the Treasury of the Radiant Light"), a concise guide to meditation practice. He died in 1280, having dedicated over forty-five years to preserving and transmitting his teacher's legacy. Today, when practitioners read Dōgen's words, they do so thanks to Kōun Ejō's faithful stewardship.</p>`,
