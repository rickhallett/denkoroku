  content: `<p>Inzan Ien (隱山惟琰) was a dynamic Rinzai master whose vigorous teaching style established one of the two main streams of Hakuin Zen that continue to this day. Together with his dharma brother Takujū Kōsen, he formalized the kōan curriculum inherited from their teacher Gasan Jitō, creating the systematic approach to kōan training that defines contemporary Rinzai practice.</p>
    <p>Born in 1751 in Echizen Province (present-day Fukui Prefecture), Inzan became a monk at the young age of nine. At sixteen, he began Zen training under Bankoku, a master in the Bankei lineage. After three years, seeking deeper training, he moved to study under Gessen Zen'e, with whom he trained for seven years. In 1789, he went to Gasan Jitō—who had been Gessen's former student and was an eminent successor of Hakuin—for further refinement. After just two years, Gasan recognized his attainment.</p>
    <p>Inzan's character was forceful, direct, and brimming with vital energy. His approach to kōan work was dynamic and intuitive rather than methodical. He emphasized the explosive quality of breakthrough—the moment when conceptual barriers shatter and original nature reveals itself. Students training in the Inzan style are pushed toward spontaneous, vivid expression of their insight.</p>
    <p>In 1808, Inzan became abbot of Myōshinji, the head temple of the largest Rinzai branch, demonstrating the respect his attainment commanded. His tenure there helped cement the Hakuin-lineage reforms throughout the Rinzai institution.</p>
    <p>The contrast between Inzan and his dharma brother Takujū was marked. Where Inzan was dynamic and explosive, Takujū was meticulous and methodical, requiring students to examine every detail of each kōan with painstaking care. As one teacher summarized: "Inzan was vigorous, very dynamic; Takujū was meticulous, very careful in his study." These different personalities shaped two distinct approaches to the same curriculum.</p>
    <p>All active Rinzai lineages today descend from either the Inzan school or the Takujū school. The teaching methods are nearly identical in content—both use the same kōan curriculum—but differ in style and emphasis. The Inzan lineage tends toward vital, immediate expression; the Takujū lineage toward thorough, detailed examination.</p>
    <p>Through his dharma descendants, Inzan's vigorous spirit continues to enliven Rinzai training. The Myōshinji tradition—including figures like Sōen Nakagawa, who helped bring Rinzai Zen to America—flows largely through the Inzan line, carrying forward his dynamic approach to awakening.</p>`,
