  content: `<p>Tettsū Gikai (徹通義介) was the third abbot of Eiheiji and a pivotal—if controversial—figure in early Japanese Sōtō Zen. His innovations to make Zen more accessible to the laity would eventually become the standard form of Sōtō practice, and his dharma heir Keizan Jōkin would transform Sōtō into one of Japan's largest Buddhist schools.</p>
    <p>Born in 1219 in rural Echizen Province (present-day Fukui Prefecture), Gikai came from a family claiming descent from the famous General Fujiwara no Toshihito. He became a monk at age twelve at a Daruma-shū temple near the future site of Eiheiji. His teacher was Ekan, who in 1241 brought most of his Daruma-shū students to join Dōgen's community at Kōshōji near Kyoto. Thus Gikai, along with his teacher, became students of Dōgen.</p>
    <p>Gikai received dharma transmission from Ekan in 1251 and, after Dōgen's death, received a second transmission from Kōun Ejō in 1255—a dual transmission that reflected both his Daruma-shū background and his Sōtō training. When Ejō retired due to illness in 1267, Gikai became the third abbot of Eiheiji.</p>
    <p>His abbacy proved controversial. Gikai introduced practices designed to make Sōtō Zen more appealing to ordinary Japanese people, including elements from esoteric Buddhism such as prayers, rituals, and incantations. Some monks felt these innovations betrayed Dōgen's emphasis on pure zazen practice, leading to the "Third Generation Controversy" (<em>sandai sōron</em>). Critics argued that Dōgen would have disapproved of such accommodations to popular taste.</p>
    <p>Despite supporters who saw his innovations as skillful means to spread the dharma, opposition grew. In 1272, Ejō reluctantly resumed the abbacy. Gikai remained at Eiheiji for some years but eventually departed permanently in 1287, even though the temple's major patron supported him. He traveled to neighboring Kaga Province and in 1293 became the second abbot of Daijōji Temple, where he rebuilt the community and continued teaching.</p>
    <p>History has vindicated Gikai in some ways: his innovations did become standard Sōtō practice, helping the school reach millions of laypeople. More importantly, he ordained a seven-year-old boy named Keizan in 1271 and later transmitted the dharma to him in 1294. Keizan would go on to found Sōjiji Temple and become known as the "Great Patriarch"—establishing the accessible Sōtō Zen that flourishes today, built on foundations Gikai helped lay.</p>`,
