  title: "Tiāntóng Rújìng",
  dates: "1163–1228",
  content: `<p>Tiāntóng Rújìng (天童如淨, Japanese: Tendō Nyojō) was the Chan master who transmitted the dharma to Dōgen, making him the spiritual source of Japanese Sōtō Zen. Though less known in China than other masters, his uncompromising emphasis on "just sitting" (<em>zhǐguǎn dǎzuò</em>) and his rigorous approach to practice profoundly shaped the meditation tradition that Dōgen would bring to Japan.</p>
    <p>Rújìng lived from 1163 to 1228 and served as abbot of several large monasteries, most notably Tiāntóng Temple (Jǐngdé-sì) in eastern China—the same temple where the great master Hóngzhī Zhèngjué had developed the "silent illumination" (<em>mòzhào</em>) approach to meditation decades earlier. In taking up this abbacy, Rújìng inherited and continued Hóngzhī's contemplative tradition.</p>
    <p>Despite his position, Rújìng was known for his humility and austere lifestyle. He wore the simple black robe of an ordinary monk, declining to don the purple vestment of honor offered by the Emperor. When he became abbot, he did not set himself above the other monks, continuing to participate in all the common duties of monastery life, including cleaning the latrines.</p>
    <p>When Dōgen arrived at Tiāntóng in 1223 after an initially discouraging journey through China, he found in Rújìng the authentic master he had sought. In 1225, Dōgen met Rújìng in intense face-to-face encounters (<em>menjū</em>) and began studying closely with him. The pivotal breakthrough came when Dōgen experienced "casting off body and mind" (<em>shinjin datsuraku</em>)—a phrase that became central to Sōtō teaching. Rújìng confirmed Dōgen's realization and transmitted the dharma to him.</p>
    <p>Rújìng taught that meditation should have no aim beyond itself—not seeking to become Buddha, not trying to attain enlightenment, just sitting in pure, objectless awareness. This "just sitting" (<em>shikantaza</em>), a term Rújìng is credited with coining, became the hallmark of Sōtō Zen practice. He told Dōgen: "The practice of zazen is the casting off of body and mind. You don't need incense, worship, recitation of Buddha's name, confession, or reading sutras—just sit."</p>
    <p>Rújìng's transmission to Dōgen ensured that this pure tradition of seated meditation would take root in Japan and eventually spread throughout the world. He died in 1228, the year after Dōgen's return to Japan.</p>`,
