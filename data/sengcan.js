  content: `<p>Sēngcàn (僧璨), the Third Chinese Patriarch of Chan, is the most enigmatic figure among the early patriarchs. Almost nothing is known of his life with certainty, yet his attributed poem, the <em>Xīnxīn Míng</em> (信心銘, "Verses on the Faith Mind"), became one of the earliest and most beloved expressions of Chan teaching, chanted in temples to this day.</p>
    <p>According to the <em>Denkōroku</em> ("Transmission of the Light"), Sēngcàn was over forty years old when he first met Huìkě around 551 CE. He was a layman suffering from a severe skin disease, possibly leprosy. His first words to the Second Patriarch were: "My body is gravely ill. Please, Master, absolve me of my sins."</p>
    <p>Huìkě replied: "Bring me your sins and I will absolve them." After a long pause, Sēngcàn said: "I have searched for my sins but cannot find them." Huìkě responded: "Then I have absolved you. Now live by the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha." Recognizing his deep capacity, Huìkě ordained him on the spot, giving him the name Sēngcàn ("Jewel of the Sangha").</p>
    <p>The <em>Xīnxīn Míng</em>, attributed to Sēngcàn, opens with the famous lines: "The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised." The poem expresses the practice of equanimity—taking both pleasant and unpleasant experiences without grasping or aversion. It teaches the principle of non-duality: "One thing, all things; move among and intermingle, without distinction."</p>
    <p>The text shows influences from Daoism, using terms like <em>wúwéi</em> (non-action) and <em>zìrán</em> (naturalness), demonstrating how Chan adapted indigenous Chinese philosophy to express Buddhist awakening. Modern scholars suggest the <em>Xīnxīn Míng</em> may have been composed after Sēngcàn's time, but the attribution reflects his symbolic role as a pivotal figure in early Chan's development.</p>
    <p>Sēngcàn transmitted the dharma to Dàoxìn before passing away, according to legend, while standing beneath a tree with his palms joined in <em>gasshō</em>.</p>`,
