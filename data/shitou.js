  content: `<p>Shítóu Xīqiān (石頭希遷, "Stone Head Who Hopes to Ascend"), known in Japanese as Sekitō Kisen, was one of the most influential Chan masters of the Tang Dynasty. His name derives from his practice of sitting in meditation on a stone slab on Mount Nányuè in Hunan Province. Together with his contemporary Mǎzǔ Dàoyī, he is an ancestor of all surviving branches of Chan and Zen Buddhism.</p>
    <p>At age thirteen, Shítóu met the Sixth Patriarch Huìnéng shortly before Huìnéng's death. Though too young to receive transmission, the encounter left a deep impression. Huìnéng reportedly advised the young Shítóu to seek out "Xíngsī" (Qīngyuán Xíngsī) when he was ready. After years of preparation, Shítóu did just that, eventually receiving dharma transmission from Qīngyuán and settling on Mount Nányuè in 742.</p>
    <p>His fame spread throughout China as the master who sat immovable on his stone, offering teachings of remarkable subtlety. A popular saying of the time reflected the two great teaching centers: "In Jiangxi there is Mǎzǔ; in Hunan there is Shítóu." Students traveled between both masters, each representing a distinct yet complementary approach to awakening.</p>
    <p>Shítóu's masterwork is the <em>Cāntóngqì</em> (參同契, "Inquiry into Matching Halves," known in Japanese as the <em>Sandōkai</em>), a poem still chanted daily in Sōtō Zen temples worldwide. The poem explores the fundamental dialectic between the universal and the particular, absolute truth and phenomenal reality. It opens: "The mind of the great sage of India is intimately transmitted from West to East. Human faculties may be keen or dull, but the Way has no Northern or Southern Ancestors."</p>
    <p>He also composed the <em>Cǎo'ān Gē</em> ("Song of the Grass-Roof Hermitage"), celebrating the simple life of secluded meditation: "I've built a grass hut where there's nothing of value... Though the hut is small, it includes the entire world."</p>
    <p>Shítóu's teaching emphasizes the interpenetration of difference and sameness: "In the light there is darkness, but don't take it as darkness; in the dark there is light, but don't see it as light." This non-dual approach, neither grasping at oneness nor at multiplicity, became foundational to the Caodong/Sōtō school's philosophy and practice.</p>`,
