  content: `<p>Kanzan Egen (関山慧玄), posthumously honored as Musō Daishi ("National Teacher of No Form"), was the founder of Myōshinji Temple and the third patriarch of the Ōtōkan lineage. He lived with such simplicity and self-effacement that he left almost no written records—yet through him, over half of all Rinzai Zen temples in Japan trace their lineage, making him one of the most influential figures in Japanese Buddhism.</p>
    <p>Born in 1277 in Shinano Province (present-day Nagano Prefecture), Kanzan began his Buddhist training in Kamakura. He spent a short time with Nanpo Jōmyō (Daiō Kokushi), who recognized his capacity and gave him his Buddhist name, Egen. Shortly after their meeting, Nanpo died, and Kanzan returned to his home province, where he lived for years as a hermit in a thatched hut.</p>
    <p>Twenty years passed before Kanzan chanced to learn that Nanpo's dharma heir, Shūhō Myōchō (Daitō Kokushi), was teaching at Daitokuji in Kyoto. He sought out Shūhō and completed his training under him. When Emperor Hanazono wished to establish a new temple, Shūhō—then in poor health—recommended his dharma heir Kanzan to lead it. In 1342, Kanzan was brought to Kyoto and installed as the founding abbot of Myōshinji.</p>
    <p>Kanzan's style was radically simple. While other Kyoto temples competed in opulence and prestige, Myōshinji remained humble. Kanzan wore the plainest robes and refused elaborate rituals. The monks grew their own food in temple gardens. Buildings were allowed to age without repair; the roof sometimes leaked. Kanzan had no worldly ambitions—he sought only to maintain the purity of Zen practice.</p>
    <p>He left almost nothing behind: no literary works, no portraits painted during his lifetime, only a few documents including the certificate of enlightenment (<em>inka</em>) given to his disciple. This was deliberate: "What are sutras?" he taught. "They are no more than paper to wipe away filth." True teaching was mind-to-mind transmission, not words on paper.</p>
    <p>Yet this unassuming master became the fountain from which the largest stream of Rinzai Zen would flow. The Myōshinji school today includes approximately 3,400 temples—nearly as many as all other Rinzai branches combined. Through his dharma descendants, the lineage eventually reached Hakuin Ekaku, who would revive Rinzai Zen three centuries later.</p>
    <p>Kanzan died in 1360. In the centuries since, his example of simplicity, integrity, and pure practice has remained the ideal of Rinzai Zen—the master who left no trace but transformed Japanese Buddhism forever.</p>`,
