  content: `<p>Mahākāśyapa (Pali: Mahākassapa) was one of the principal disciples of the Buddha and is revered as the First Patriarch in the Zen lineage. Before encountering the Buddha, he was already known as a Brahmin ascetic of exceptional attainment, practicing austerities in search of liberation.</p>
    <p>According to tradition, he met the Buddha on the road between Rājagaha and Nālandā. Recognizing each other's spiritual depth, the Buddha accepted him as a disciple. Mahākāśyapa became foremost among the Buddha's disciples in ascetic practice (<em>dhutaṅga</em>), maintaining the most rigorous lifestyle of any monk—wearing only robes made from discarded cloth and eating only alms food received directly into his bowl.</p>
    <p>The pivotal moment that established him as the first patriarch comes from the famous Flower Sermon: At Vulture Peak, the Buddha silently held up a white flower before the assembly. While all others sat in puzzled silence, Mahākāśyapa alone broke into a subtle smile. The Buddha declared: "I possess the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvana, the true form of the formless, the subtle dharma gate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside of the scriptures. This I entrust to Mahākāśyapa."</p>
    <p>This wordless exchange—the first instance of mind-to-mind transmission—became the founding story of Chan/Zen Buddhism, establishing the principle that ultimate truth cannot be captured in concepts but must be directly realized.</p>
    <p>After the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, Mahākāśyapa assumed leadership of the sangha and convened the First Buddhist Council at Rājagaha, where Ānanda recited the sutras and Upāli recited the Vinaya, establishing the oral canon that would preserve the Buddha's teachings. According to legend, Mahākāśyapa entered meditation on Mount Kukkuṭapāda, where he remains in samādhi, awaiting the coming of Maitreya Buddha.</p>`,
