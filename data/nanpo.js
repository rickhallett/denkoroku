  content: `<p>Nanpo Jōmyō (南浦紹明), posthumously honored as Daiō Kokushi ("National Teacher of the Great Response"), was the founder of the Ōtōkan lineage—the only surviving line of Rinzai Zen, from which all contemporary Rinzai masters descend. His journey to Song China and his transmission from Xūtáng Zhìyú ensured that authentic Rinzai dharma would flourish in Japan.</p>
    <p>Born in 1235 to the Sasaki clan, Nanpo showed early spiritual inclination. At fifteen, he became a monk, and at eighteen, he sought out the Chinese master Lánxī Dàolóng (Rankei Dōryū), who had come to Japan and established Kenchōji in Kamakura as a Rinzai training monastery. Under Rankei's rigorous instruction, Nanpo made rapid progress.</p>
    <p>In 1259, at age twenty-four, Nanpo made the dangerous sea voyage to Song China to deepen his training. He eventually found his way to Master Xūtáng Zhìyú (Kidō Chigu), Rankei's dharma brother, at Mount Jing. After six years of intensive kōan practice, in 1265, Nanpo experienced profound awakening. Xūtáng recognized his realization and transmitted the dharma to him, making Nanpo the bearer of an authentic Chinese Rinzai lineage.</p>
    <p>Returning to Japan in 1267, Nanpo taught at various temples but eventually settled at Sōfukuji in Hakata (present-day Fukuoka), where he trained students for over thirty years. Away from the political intrigues of Kamakura and Kyoto, he focused on transmitting authentic Zen practice rather than seeking institutional prestige.</p>
    <p>The name "Ōtōkan" derives from the first three patriarchs of this Japanese lineage: the "ō" of Daiō Kokushi (Nanpo), the "tō" of Daitō Kokushi (Shūhō Myōchō), and the "kan" of Kanzan Egen. Every living Rinzai teacher today traces their dharma ancestry through this line.</p>
    <p>Nanpo transmitted the dharma to several students, but his most significant heir was Shūhō Myōchō (Daitō Kokushi), the brilliant young monk who would later found Daitokuji and become one of Japan's most celebrated Zen masters. Through Shūhō, Nanpo's lineage would spread through Myōshinji and Daitokuji, the two great Rinzai temple networks that continue today.</p>
    <p>The Emperor granted Nanpo the posthumous title Daiō Kokushi after his death in 1309, honoring him as a National Teacher. His legacy lives on in every Rinzai monastery where students sit with kōans, struggle toward breakthrough, and carry forward the living tradition he brought from China.</p>`,
