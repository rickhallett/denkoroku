  content: `<p>Gasan Jitō (峨山慈棹) was the pivotal figure through whom Hakuin Ekaku's revived Rinzai Zen was transmitted to future generations. Though he was not among Hakuin's closest disciples, his teaching produced the two streams—through Inzan Ien and Takujū Kōsen—from which all contemporary Rinzai lineages descend. Every Rinzai master alive today traces their dharma ancestry through Gasan.</p>
    <p>Born in 1727, Gasan first trained under Gessen Zen'e, a respected Rinzai teacher, receiving dharma transmission from him. Later, he encountered Hakuin and was so deeply impressed by the master's teaching that he undertook kōan study with him. However, Gasan completed his kōan training not directly under Hakuin but under Tōrei Enji, one of Hakuin's principal heirs.</p>
    <p>This unusual training history—receiving transmission from one teacher, studying with Hakuin, and completing training with yet another—gave Gasan a comprehensive grounding in the revived Rinzai tradition. After completing his training, he established himself at Rinshōin, a small temple in Edo (present-day Tokyo), where his reputation attracted over five hundred students.</p>
    <p>Gasan's most important contribution was the development—either by himself or in collaboration with his principal students Inzan Ien and Takujū Kōsen—of a systematized kōan curriculum that formalized Hakuin's approach. This curriculum organized kōans into categories: <em>hosshin</em> (dharma-body) kōans to awaken initial insight into emptiness, <em>kikan</em> (dynamic action) kōans, <em>gonsen</em> (word investigation) kōans, <em>nantō</em> (difficult to penetrate) kōans, and the "Five Ranks" of Dōngshān. This structure, with fixed questions and systematic responses, became the standard method of Rinzai training.</p>
    <p>Gasan's two principal heirs developed distinct teaching styles that persist to this day. Inzan Ien (1751–1814) was vigorous and dynamic, his approach emphasizing the vital energy of breakthrough. Takujū Kōsen (1760–1833) was meticulous and careful, his method requiring thorough examination of every aspect of each kōan. These two streams—the Inzan-ha and Takujū-ha—created parallel but complementary approaches to kōan practice.</p>
    <p>Though less famous than Hakuin before him or the masters who followed, Gasan was the essential link. Without his systematic transmission of Hakuin's teaching through his extraordinary students, the revival of Rinzai Zen might not have outlasted a single generation. Through him, Hakuin's dharma flows to every Rinzai practitioner today.</p>`,
