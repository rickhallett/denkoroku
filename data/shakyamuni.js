  content: `<p>Siddhārtha Gautama, known after his awakening as the Buddha ("Awakened One") or Śākyamuni ("Sage of the Śākyas"), is the historical founder of Buddhism. Born a prince in Lumbini (in present-day Nepal) to King Śuddhodana and Queen Māyā, he lived his early years sheltered within the palace walls, shielded from the suffering of the world.</p>
    <p>According to tradition, at age 29, Siddhārtha encountered four sights that would transform his life: an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and a wandering ascetic. Confronted with the inevitability of aging, sickness, and death, he renounced his royal inheritance and embarked on a spiritual quest to understand the nature of suffering and find a path beyond it.</p>
    <p>For six years he practiced extreme asceticism, nearly starving himself to death, before realizing that neither indulgence nor self-mortification led to liberation. Adopting a "Middle Way" between these extremes, he sat beneath a pipal tree in Bodh Gaya and vowed not to rise until he had attained enlightenment. On the night of the full moon, he achieved complete awakening, penetrating the nature of reality and breaking free from the cycle of rebirth.</p>
    <p>For the remaining forty-five years of his life, the Buddha taught the Dharma throughout the Ganges Valley, establishing a community (sangha) of monks, nuns, and lay followers. His core teachings—the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path—offered a practical method for anyone to realize liberation. He emphasized direct experience over mere belief, famously instructing his followers to test his teachings for themselves.</p>
    <p>The Buddha passed into parinirvāṇa at age 80 in Kushinagar, leaving behind a legacy that would spread across Asia and eventually the world. His final words, according to the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, were: "All conditioned things are impermanent. Work out your own salvation with diligence."</p>`,
