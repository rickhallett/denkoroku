  content: `<p>Bodhidharma (菩提達磨, Japanese: Daruma) is the legendary monk credited with transmitting Chan Buddhism from India to China, becoming the First Chinese Patriarch. A semi-historical figure shrouded in mystery and myth, his fierce gaze and uncompromising teaching style have made him an enduring icon of Zen.</p>
    <p>According to tradition, Bodhidharma was a prince from South India, possibly Kanchipuram, who studied under Prajñātāra for some forty years before receiving the instruction to carry the dharma to China. Arriving during the Liang Dynasty (around 520–527 CE), he famously met Emperor Wu, a great patron of Buddhism who had built temples and supported monks throughout his realm.</p>
    <p>When the Emperor asked what merit he had gained from all his good works, Bodhidharma replied bluntly: "No merit whatsoever." Asked to explain the highest meaning of the holy teachings, he responded: "Vast emptiness, nothing holy." The Emperor, bewildered, demanded: "Who are you who stands before me?" Bodhidharma answered: "I don't know." This exchange, where Bodhidharma cut through all the Emperor's conceptual understanding, became one of Zen's most famous encounter dialogues.</p>
    <p>Finding no receptive student, Bodhidharma traveled to the Shaolin Monastery on Mount Song, where legend says he sat facing a wall in meditation for nine years. This practice of <em>bìguān</em> (wall-gazing) became synonymous with his teaching. One tale recounts that he fell asleep after seven years and, in anger at himself, cut off his eyelids—from which the first tea plants grew, thereafter providing monks with a stimulant for meditation.</p>
    <p>His teaching, recorded in texts like the <em>Bloodstream Sermon</em>, was radically direct: "Seeing your own nature is Zen. Not thinking about anything is Zen. Everything you do is Zen." He taught that Buddha-nature is inherent in all beings—not something to be acquired through merit or study, but to be directly realized through meditation and insight.</p>
    <p>Bodhidharma's transmission to his successor Huìkě established the Chinese Chan lineage that would eventually spread throughout East Asia. His four hallmarks remain central to Zen: "A special transmission outside the scriptures; No reliance on words and letters; Direct pointing to the human mind; Seeing one's nature and becoming a Buddha."</p>`,
