  content: `<p>Keizan Jōkin (瑩山紹瑾, "Bright Mountain, Succeeding the Line") is revered alongside Dōgen as one of the "Two Founders" of Japanese Sōtō Zen. While Dōgen established the philosophical and meditative foundations, Keizan transformed Sōtō into a widespread popular religion. His founding of Sōjiji Temple and his composition of the <em>Denkōroku</em> ("Transmission of the Light") secured his legacy as the "Great Patriarch."</p>
    <p>Born in 1264 in Echizen Province, Keizan was raised in a family deeply devoted to Buddhism. His grandmother and mother were both dedicated practitioners, and Keizan later credited their influence as vital to his own development—an acknowledgment unusual for his time and reflecting his lifelong support for women in Buddhism.</p>
    <p>At age seven, Keizan was ordained by Tettsū Gikai at Eiheiji. At thirteen, he entered formal training and began studying under multiple teachers, eventually receiving dharma transmission from Gikai in 1294 after returning to serve under him at Daijōji. Unlike many of his contemporaries who considered practice with one teacher sufficient, Keizan's training under various masters gave him a breadth of perspective that informed his later teaching.</p>
    <p>Keizan's greatest institutional achievement was founding Sōjiji Temple in 1322, which rapidly eclipsed Eiheiji as the principal Sōtō temple. Under his leadership and that of his successors, Sōjiji became the head of vast temple networks throughout Japan. By 1589, the imperial court recognized Sōjiji as the official head temple of the Sōtō school. Today, the great majority of Sōtō clergy trace their dharma lineage through Keizan.</p>
    <p>His masterwork, the <em>Denkōroku</em> ("Transmission of the Light"), presents fifty-one awakening stories—from Śākyamuni Buddha through the Indian and Chinese ancestors to Dōgen and Ejō. Each chapter includes a main case, explanatory commentary, Keizan's own teaching (<em>teishō</em>), and a capping verse. This work makes the lineage accessible and alive, demonstrating that the same awakening realized by the Buddha can be realized by anyone.</p>
    <p>Keizan was also notably progressive in supporting women's practice. Following his mother's example, he gave the first dharma transmission to a Sōtō nun—his student Ekyū—establishing a precedent for women's full participation in the tradition.</p>
    <p>He composed the <em>Zazen Yōjinki</em> ("Notes on Zazen"), a practical guide still used today, and established numerous temples that spread Sōtō Zen throughout Japan. He died in 1325, having built the institutional foundations that would make Sōtō one of the largest Buddhist denominations in the world.</p>`,
